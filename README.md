# Blue Apron Schema

Figure out what entities you'll need, and what relationships they should have.  Some possible entities: User, Recipe, Promotion, Delivery, ServicePlan

Visualize the schema [Quick Database Diagrams](https://www.quickdatabasediagrams.com/).

Implement the schema following the model of [cars database](https://github.com/Code-Platoon-Assignments/sql-cars). 
2 or three rows of dummy data per table is fine. If you don't want to make up the data yourself, you can try [this](https://www.mockaroo.com/).

Write a few queries against it to make sure everything is working.
